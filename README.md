# Cryptography
A Java assignment for an undergrad course. 
The Caesar Cipher technique shifts every letter in the given information to
another letter by moving clockwise. For example, if the information is
“Hello” and the shift key is 5. Then the encrypted information is “Mjqqt”.
To decrypt the message, you must shift anti-clockwise with the given
shift key.
This program  implements the Caesar Cipher technology, both
encryption and decryption. The program should ask the user to enter a
message and a shift key. The program is able to receive the information
with different kinds of characters (not only alphabetic letters) accepted in UI. Characters
keep the same if they are not alphabetic letters.
